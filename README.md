PART-1: Configure App
  In this section we will take care of getting our project set up. We'll first install Django and handle basic configuration.
  
  STEP1--Assuming you have Python installed, open up your command prompt and Pip install Django if you have not already done so.
  STEP2--Let's create our project. CD into where you want your project files.
       --We will use django-admin startproject “project name”.
       --Once you create your project be sure to CD into it before the next step.
